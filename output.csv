T_GAME_EVENT_INVESTMENT_BUISINESSTRIP_SUCCESS,"Tôi đã trở về, thưa Thống đốc. Tôi nghĩ rằng tôi đã tìm thấy một số cách tốt để chúng ta đầu tư một cách có lợi. Với một chút may mắn, chúng ta sẽ sớm giàu có hơn!"

T_GAME_EVENT_INVESTMENT_CHOICE_POPUP_01_DESC_01,Ngài có muốn tham gia vào các giao dịch không? Điều đó có nghĩa là Ngài phải làm cho đối tác của tôi ở thủ đô cảm thấy thích thú. Chỉ việc này thôi cũng có thể tốn của bạn rất nhiều và tôi phải dành một ít thời gian ở đó để chuẩn bị tất cả mọi thứ.

T_GAME_EVENT_INVESTMENT_HIGHRISK_MEDIUMAMOUNT_FAIL,"Thưa Thống đốc, tôi e rằng mình đã mạo hiểm quá mức. Kết quả của các cuộc đàm phán không mấy tích cực. Thay vì giảm giá hàng hóa, trí thông minh buôn bán khác thường của tôi lại gây ra hoàn toàn ngược lại."

T_GAME_QUEST_ENEMIES_FLOWERS_DRINKS_004,Didn't you say anything about drinks? Why wood now?
T_GAME_QUEST_ENEMIES_FLOWERS_DRINKS_005,"To make decent barrels, come on! The former owner did not even have proper barrels to store the drinks. Suppliers must be using bad wood. So we have to collect enough wood and iron bars to make it ourselves."
T_GAME_QUEST_ENEMIES_FLOWERS_DRINKS_006,Great! They're beautiful!

T_GAME_QUEST_ENEMIES_FLOWERS_TAVERNE_DIALOGUE_001,"What are you saying, Sire?! You help this young woman with her inn and what about me? You won't help me with my tavern!"
T_GAME_QUEST_ENEMIES_FLOWERS_TAVERNE_DIALOGUE_002,"Come on, behave yourself when you address the governor."

T_GAME_QUEST_FORTUNE_TELLER_ANSWER_BYE_002,"Queen Frygith, come on, don't get angry about such a little thing. It's just a refreshment. Don't be so dramatic."
T_GAME_QUEST_FORTUNE_TELLER_ANSWER_BYE_003,I see that even your advisor is starting to disrespect me…
T_GAME_QUEST_FORTUNE_TELLER_ANSWER_BYE_004,"The situation is completely out of control, you no longer know what to do and your stress levels are only rising. \n\nHow do you react?"

T_GAME_QUEST_FORTUNE_TELLER_ANSWER_CALM_004,"Several months have passed since the famous ball. You and Queen Frigith have an epistolary relationship. Sometimes she comes to see you when the weather allows it.\n\nPerhaps one day, she will choose you as King of her kingdom. But for now, she has too much on her plate to make a place for herself as a queen.\n\nAnd so do you! You must continue to do everything in your power to keep your city running smoothly."
T_GAME_QUEST_FORTUNE_TELLER_ANSWER_CALM_005,"The townies are also happy for you and the Queen. They have observed an increase in travelers, they come mainly to taste the grape juice and drink which the queen was refused during the party.

The cards tell me that in the past, they have already tried to approach you, but without much success.\n\nYou have been warned."
T_GAME_QUEST_FORTUNE_TELLER_ANSWER_CARDS_005,"A wonderful draw, Sire! All positive. You will meet a woman, a great woman who will turn your heart upside down. Love is on the horizon! Be ready when she knocks on your door."

T_GAME_QUEST_FORTUNE_TELLER_ANSWER_CARDS_LEFT_002,This card indicates that you have a very dark part in you and it will lead you to self-destruction. I fear that this will affect the productivity of your people.
T_GAME_QUEST_FORTUNE_TELLER_ANSWER_CARDS_LEFT_003,"I sense that you are confused and that your advisor is pushing you to leave. But stay a while, it's not over yet. A second draw may provide more specific answers."

T_GAME_QUEST_FORTUNE_TELLER_ANSWER_CRY_002,"Panicked, you escape from the ballroom and run to your room to collapse while crying in your bed.\n\nEverything suggests that you're suffering from a broken heart. Only time alone can remedy this."
T_GAME_QUEST_FORTUNE_TELLER_ANSWER_CRY_003,"For several months now, you have been slowly recovering from your broken heart.\n\nQueen Frygith has never tried to find out how you were doing, she doesn't care about you at all.\n\nOn the other hand, you have made history and now appear in books as the governor in love. This has won you the sympathy of the people and they are now working more efficiently."

T_GAME_QUEST_FORTUNE_TELLER_ANSWER_FORTUNE_002,"In company of your advisor, you decide to go to the fortune teller's house. Maybe she can help you to prevent some misfortunes or perhaps provide you great news."
T_GAME_QUEST_FORTUNE_TELLER_ANSWER_FORTUNE_003,"The fortune teller is not far from the castle. You enter the small tent. You're surrounded by a whole lot of mystical objects.

T_GAME_QUEST_FORTUNE_TELLER_ANSWER_JUICE_001,Bring her some grape juice.
T_GAME_QUEST_FORTUNE_TELLER_ANSWER_LOVE_001,"You can admire the parades from the top of your castle. And suddenly, in the distance, you see a procession coming. Your attention falls on a beautiful woman. Your heart is overwhelmed. \n\nIs that what love at first sight is all about?"
T_GAME_QUEST_FORTUNE_TELLER_ANSWER_LOVE_002,"Mad about love, you decide to go and meet this beautiful stranger. Almost missing a step going down the stairs of your castle, you go down the steps on all fours. Your advisor, towering next to you, doesn't understand what is going on with you."
T_GAME_QUEST_FORTUNE_TELLER_ANSWER_LOVE_003,"Sire, this is Queen Frygith. I don't know what motivated you to get to her so quickly."

T_GAME_QUEST_FORTUNE_TELLER_ANSWER_NO_001,Decline the invitation.
T_GAME_QUEST_FORTUNE_TELLER_ANSWER_NO_002,"You did the right thing, Governor. Who knows what kinds of problems we would have gotten ourselves into!"
T_GAME_QUEST_FORTUNE_TELLER_ANSWER_NO_LOVE_007,"Broken-hearted, you decide not to attend the ball at all. You are grieving for a long time. And it is being reflected in your city. The productivity and happiness of the inhabitants are declining. Let's hope it doesn't last."
T_GAME_QUEST_FORTUNE_TELLER_ANSWER_NO_LOVE_008,You start seeing the light at the end of the tunnel again and your sadness is now overcome. You slowly start coming out of your room again.\n\nThe people are pleased with your recovery and this is affecting their productivity and morale positively.

T_GAME_QUEST_FORTUNE_TELLER_ANSWER_YES_001,I'd be happy to go!
T_GAME_QUEST_FORTUNE_TELLER_CHURCH_BAD_001,"Oh Sire, it's terrible. The people forced to go to church are completely demoralized. They're at the end of their rope. Let us pray in return that they will get over it! It was a bad decision to make the service mandatory!"
T_GAME_QUEST_FORTUNE_TELLER_CHURCH_BAD_002,This whole church and fortune teller thing is behind us now. The people are beginning to regain their happiness.
T_GAME_QUEST_FORTUNE_TELLER_CHURCH_GOOD_001,"This decision was beneficial to us, Sire! You did the right thing by making the service mandatory. The townies are now happier and more productive."

T_GAME_QUEST_FORTUNE_TELLER_CHURCH_NEXT_REFUSE_003,"Since religion is of little importance to you, we will destroy places of worship! "
T_GAME_QUEST_FORTUNE_TELLER_CHURCH_NEXT_REFUSE_004,"Sire, it's awful! Angry monks are destroying buildings in the city! And it was impossible to catch them, they fled! This will teach you to consult fortune tellers, see where it has led us."

T_GAME_QUEST_FRESH_FISH_CONSEQUENCE_002_002,All the fishermen's huts have been checked and the fish is edible again! You were right to invest in this decision. We avoided serious problems.
T_GAME_QUEST_FRESH_FISH_CONSEQUENCE_003,The destruction of these fishermen's huts has allowed us to eliminate the possible contamination of the fish. It's a pity to have such beautiful buildings destroyed though.
T_GAME_QUEST_FRESH_FISH_DESC,"Governor, I'm don't want to be fussy, but I must admit that your fish... It's not what it used to be. I don't know if it's because of the river or because of something else but they're absolutely disgusting! Someone will get sick if you don't take care of this."

T_GAME_QUEST_GIANT_RABBIT_DESC_006_ANSWER_002,Go to the witch.
T_GAME_QUEST_GIANT_RABBIT_DESC_006_B,We could go to the witch and ask her for advice. Maybe she knows something about that infamous giant rabbit.
T_GAME_QUEST_GIANT_RABBIT_DESC_007_A,I've been waiting for you. The crows predicted your arrival. How noisy they were. But always less noisy than that rabbit's jumps.
T_GAME_QUEST_GIANT_RABBIT_DESC_007_ANSWER_001,Pray.

T_GAME_QUEST_GIANT_RABBIT_MAGIC_005,"Thank you very much, Sir. Take the potion. Put some in the village well and wait a while. The giant rabbit will leave on its own after smelling it."
T_GAME_QUEST_GIANT_RABBIT_MAGIC_006,Sir... We have to build public baths and add plenty of essential oils to them to get rid of the smell that is upon the townies... it's absolutely awful.
T_GAME_QUEST_GIANT_RABBIT_MAGIC_007,"Great! The town can finally breathe again!\nThe rabbit left without a trace, as if we had only imagined it. For the time being, my Lord, let us return to our business."
T_GAME_QUEST_GIANT_RABBIT_NOTHING,"After all, the rabbit left on his own. In one of these last jumps, he dug up a chest hidden by bandits a long time ago. The chest contained 2000 gold coins and the king finds us worthy to receive prestige!"
T_GAME_QUEST_GIANT_RABBIT_PRAY_001,Well... It took the arrival of a giant rabbit for you to finally consider building a church!

T_GAME_QUEST_KING_OF_WOOD_ANSWER_B_002,"We have other priorities at the moment, the lavender festival is starting soon and the preparations are not ready."
T_GAME_QUEST_KING_OF_WOOD_ANSWER_B_003,"Speaking of which, we should finish preparing everything."
T_GAME_QUEST_KING_OF_WOOD_ANSWER_B_004,That's better! This promises to be a lucrative event!
T_GAME_QUEST_KING_OF_WOOD_ANSWER_B_005,"Sire, I heard that the lavender merchants highly valued our cathedral. They're reluctant to go to our festival!"
T_GAME_QUEST_KING_OF_WOOD_BAD_ENDING,The lavender festival went off without a hitch… nevertheless we didn't have as many visitors as we used to! This event did not bring us any prestige.
T_GAME_QUEST_KING_OF_WOOD_DEAL_001,It's a deal!
T_GAME_QUEST_KING_OF_WOOD_DEAL_002,So let's hurry up and produce the goods for the queen.
T_GAME_QUEST_KING_OF_WOOD_DEAL_003,All we have to do now is make the exchange.
T_GAME_QUEST_KING_OF_WOOD_DEAL_004,It's a pleasure doing business with you.
T_GAME_QUEST_KING_OF_WOOD_DESC,Sire! I've got bad news! The worldwide symbol of our culture caught fire at night! The great cathedral no longer has a roof!
T_GAME_QUEST_KING_OF_WOOD_EXPERTS_001,"Experts say that we no longer have enough noble wood on our land to fix it. But Queen Frygith happens to have the necessary resources, should we ask her for help?"
T_GAME_QUEST_KING_OF_WOOD_EXPERTS_A_001,Ask for help.
T_GAME_QUEST_KING_OF_WOOD_EXPERTS_A_002,"You hasten to send a messenger to the queen. \n\n""Help me Queen Frygith! May I borrow this noble wood from you on your land? My cathedral is falling apart."
T_GAME_QUEST_KING_OF_WOOD_EXPERTS_A_003,"Hello dear, you are just in time since I have to stock up on juice, are you interested in an amicable exchange? Jars of juice against the wood you need."
T_GAME_QUEST_KING_OF_WOOD_EXPERTS_A_004,"Sire, this is not an offer in our favor…"
T_GAME_QUEST_KING_OF_WOOD_EXPERTS_A_005,You weigh the pros and cons of this deal. Maybe the queen will be the solution to all your worries... Unless there's another way?
T_GAME_QUEST_KING_OF_WOOD_EXPERTS_B_001,Think about it.
T_GAME_QUEST_KING_OF_WOOD_EXPERTS_B_002,"This request could damage our reputation, we will proceed differently. "
T_GAME_QUEST_KING_OF_WOOD_EXPERTS_B_003,"Your advisor may have a point. Asking Queen Frygith for help would push you to be dependent on her goodwill. If there will ever be a problem, you will risk losing a lot.\n\nWhy not use stone? You have a lot of it in the mines."
T_GAME_QUEST_KING_OF_WOOD_EXPERTS_B_004,"It was a good decision, Sire! We are free and independent."
T_GAME_QUEST_KING_OF_WOOD_GOOD_ENDING,The lavender festival is a success. The recent stories about the restoration of the cathedral have caused a lot of enthusiasm and we have benefited from it!
T_GAME_QUEST_KING_OF_WOOD_NO_LAVANDER_001,I never liked lavender.
T_GAME_QUEST_KING_OF_WOOD_REPAIR_001,"Well, that's fine! We're fixing it."
T_GAME_QUEST_KING_OF_WOOD_SING_001,Outrageous.
T_GAME_QUEST_KING_OF_WOOD_SING_002,"Sire, that sounds like blackmail! Let's use stone instead, so we won't have to deal with this queen!"
T_GAME_QUEST_KING_OF_WOOD_SING_003,"All right, I won't forget it, dear."
T_GAME_QUEST_KING_OF_WOOD_TITLE,King of Wood
T_GAME_QUEST_LACK_SPACE_ANSWER_001,I'll take care of it.
T_GAME_QUEST_LACK_SPACE_ANSWER_002,"If they are not happy, then they should not come anymore."
T_GAME_QUEST_LACK_SPACE_CONSEQUENCE_A_001,"It is true that merchants would benefit from having a place dedicated to them, in addition to the market. A Trade Guild would seem like the perfect building, Sire."
T_GAME_QUEST_LACK_SPACE_CONSEQUENCE_A_002,"Wonderful, Sire! Thank you for agreeing to this. We are forever grateful!"
T_GAME_QUEST_LACK_SPACE_CONSEQUENCE_B_001,A modern governor like you should have accepted the request of the merchants…
T_GAME_QUEST_LACK_SPACE_CONSEQUENCE_B_002,"Sire, I come as a representative of the merchants. In order to show our disappointment, we won't be coming to your city for a while! "

T_GAME_QUEST_LACK_SPACE_TITLE,Lack of space
T_GAME_QUEST_MICE_AND_SOLDIERS_DESC,"As you have just woken up, your advisor has some terrible news for you! The city is being invaded by mice! It's less dangerous than rats, certainly, but still. We have to do something!"
T_GAME_QUEST_MICE_AND_SOLDIERS_FISH_001,"Sire, the Academy of Mouse Hunting Cats has been established but… we must still take care of their well-being and feed them. We should provide enough fish for the academy."
T_GAME_QUEST_MICE_AND_SOLDIERS_FISH_003,"We now have enough fish to cover the training. Some recruits have already caught a lot of mice, Sire."
T_GAME_QUEST_MICE_AND_SOLDIERS_HERBS_001,"Sire, we should reward the best cats with catnip. To reduce their stress."
T_GAME_QUEST_MICE_AND_SOLDIERS_HERBS_003,"There is a noticeable increase in the effectiveness of mouse catchers, Sire. The teachers are doing a good job in training the cats. There is only a small number of mice left."
T_GAME_QUEST_MICE_AND_SOLDIERS_HERBS_004,"Mice are no longer a nuisance at all, Sire. Congratulations on your choices that led to this outcome."
T_GAME_QUEST_MICE_AND_SOLDIERS_PLAN_001,Prepare a plan.
T_GAME_QUEST_MICE_AND_SOLDIERS_PLAN_002,"You still decide to have breakfast. While eating your toast, you see a mouse in the corner of the room! They're even in the castle! And all of a sudden, you see Chouquette, your faithful cat, leaping. He eats the mouse in no time at all. "
T_GAME_QUEST_MICE_AND_SOLDIERS_PLAN_003,That gives you an idea. You instruct your advisor to catch as many cats as possible and train them in mouse hunting. Even the house cats. You want them to be trained to get rid of all these mice.
T_GAME_QUEST_MICE_AND_SOLDIERS_SLEEP_001,Go back to sleep.
T_GAME_QUEST_MICE_AND_SOLDIERS_SLEEP_002,"When you wake up, there are so many mice everywhere that it is difficult for everyone to walk properly. All your inhabitants are slowed down!"
T_GAME_QUEST_MICE_AND_SOLDIERS_SLEEP_003,The mice finally left on their own after a long time. Hiding from your responsibilities by sleeping is not always a solution.

T_GAME_QUEST_NORTHERN_DESERT_TRAVELERS_ACCEPT_002,"While your advisor escorts you home, you are still on guard. Why did they risk crossing the desert when they could have sailed along the river? Why choose a dangerous road if not to hide?\n\nMaybe your spies would be able to find out more about them. Or you might as well go to bed."
T_GAME_QUEST_NORTHERN_DESERT_TRAVELERS_ACCEPT_003,Go to bed.

T_GAME_QUEST_NORTHERN_DESERT_TRAVELERS_AFTER_006,"Thank you for your help, Governor. These people had stolen one of my precious jewels. They were planning to sell it on the black market. You did the right thing to inform me of their presence around your city."
T_GAME_QUEST_NORTHERN_DESERT_TRAVELERS_END_SILENCE_001,"Very well, Sire. If someone asks us about it, we'll say that we don't know."
T_GAME_QUEST_NORTHERN_DESERT_TRAVELERS_END_SILENCE_002,"It has been a while since anything spectacular has happened in the city. Yet today, you have the feeling that something will change.\n\nAnd you were right! Your advisor comes to bring you a letter from travelers wanted by the Royal Army. The message reads as follows: \n\n""Thank you for not reporting us, Governor. You see, we were victims of a plot and our whole family was in great danger. By keeping it secret that we were coming to your village, we had time to find the evidence of our innocence. Without you, it would have been impossible.

T_GAME_QUEST_NORTHERN_DESERT_TRAVELERS_LEAVE_TOWN_001,"Sire, the travelers left the inn in the early morning, they seemed to be in a hurry."
T_GAME_QUEST_NORTHERN_DESERT_TRAVELERS_NO_001,"Travelers are waiting for your answer. Some look aggressive, some are afraid.\n\n""I cannot offer you hospitality, travelers.

T_GAME_QUEST_NORTHERN_DESERT_TRAVELERS_NO_FOOD_002,"In the early morning, you venture out of your hiding place. The village was not damaged. It seems that these travelers simply knocked out the guards and took some provisions for the rest of their trip."
T_GAME_QUEST_NORTHERN_DESERT_TRAVELERS_NO_WEAPON_001,"Fortunately, we had planned the move, Sire. With the weapons and shields we have produced, we will be able to repel them. I'm sure of it."
T_GAME_QUEST_NORTHERN_DESERT_TRAVELERS_NO_WEAPON_002,"Sire, we have succeeded in capturing all the travelers. We locked them in the jail, the time for you to make a decision."
T_GAME_QUEST_NORTHERN_DESERT_TRAVELERS_NO_WEAPON_003,"These travelers are getting weirder. Now that they're locked up, you feel a little safer. However, something is bothering you.\n\nWhat do you need to do?"

The king sends you a reward for providing the necessary information to caputre these dangerous individuals.\n\nYour village is slowly recovering, while you are peacefully resuming your activities as governor."
T_GAME_QUEST_NORTHERN_DESERT_TRAVELERS_SPY_CATCH_001,Your spy made a mistake and was spotted by the travelers. They're holding him hostage and demanding ransom if you want to get him back alive.
T_GAME_QUEST_NORTHERN_DESERT_TRAVELERS_SPY_CATCH_PAY_001,"We're going to lose a lot of money, but at least our spy will stay safe."
T_GAME_QUEST_NORTHERN_DESERT_TRAVELERS_SPY_CATCH_PAY_002,"Thank you, Sire, for paying the ransom to free me! I was afraid of my life. What a dangerous job to be a spy."
T_GAME_QUEST_NORTHERN_DESERT_WARM_WELCOME_001,That's a great idea. We should prepare food for these people when they arrive at our doorstep. Bread and fish will do the job.
T_GAME_QUEST_NORTHERN_DESERT_WARM_WELCOME_002,"Perfect, now all we have to do is to wait for them."
T_GAME_QUEST_PLACE_STARTED,It is now time to build the appropriate location for an event of this magnitude!

T_GAME_QUEST_THE_MAGICIANS_SEARCH_004,"Your guards start chasing the second magician, when suddenly, a thick smoke covers the village. Your guards stop their pursuit, no longer seeing where they're going."
T_GAME_QUEST_THE_MAGICIANS_SEARCH_005,"Sire, we are facing a new problem! We can no longer move fast! It's like we're walking through jelly!"
T_GAME_QUEST_THE_MAGICIANS_SEARCH_006,We should retreat into the castle and question this magician we managed to capture.
T_GAME_QUEST_THE_MAGICIANS_SEARCH_007,"Following the advice, you decide to barricade yourself in the castle grounds, in order to start the interrogation of the first magician. In addition, you ask the chief of the guard to secure the castle so that no one can enter or leave the castle."
T_GAME_QUEST_THE_MAGICIANS_SECONDE_001,"You decide to keep the two magicians away from each other and question the magician you managed to catch, thanks to your amazing trap.\n\nUnfortunately, you didn't manage to recover the resources, the third magician took them with him."
T_GAME_QUEST_THE_MAGICIANS_SECONDE_002,"The second magician seems much more confident than the first. And without hesitation he tells you this: ""Congratulations Governor, you caught me with my hand in the cookie jar. But know that if you don't free me immediately, terrible things will happen to your village."
T_GAME_QUEST_THE_MAGICIANS_SECONDE_FREE_001,Free him.
T_GAME_QUEST_THE_MAGICIANS_SECONDE_FREE_002,"You are far too afraid of what your village might go through and decide to free him.\n\n""You are a player, Governor,"" said the magician, before disappearing into a halo of smoke the very moment the guards removed the chains."
T_GAME_QUEST_THE_MAGICIANS_SECONDE_FREE_003,Sire! The first magician also escaped! His brother appeared next to him and then they both disappeared!
T_GAME_QUEST_THE_MAGICIANS_SECONDE_FREE_004,...We're back to square one.
T_GAME_QUEST_THE_MAGICIANS_SECONDE_FREE_005,"We will patrol for these rascals, Sire! You can trust us."

T_GAME_QUEST_THE_MAGICIANS_SECONDE_FREE_007,"For a long time, your guards have been trying to find these magicians. Unsuccessfully so far. However, day after day, the city saw the strange cloud of smoke that was slowing everyone down slowly dissipate.\n\nThe mystery surrounding these magicians will remain unsolved."

T_GAME_QUEST_THIEF_OF_JOY_ANSWER_SPY_001,That's a wise decision. Let's send our best spies to follow this crazy townie and wait for their report.
T_GAME_QUEST_THIEF_OF_JOY_ANSWER_SPY_002,"Your spies came back with a report.\n\n""We followed this townie, the thief of joy. It seems that his word triggers great sadness in the inhabitants. The townies don't remember the joyful moments of their lives."

Only science can explain and solve this problem of the thief of joy.\n\nYou call your best scientists to work on a formula that would allow the townies to be happy again.\n\nOf course, science is not free.

However, cases of depressed townies have continued to increase drastically.\n\nDisoriented, you went to take refuge in your castle. Not knowing what to do about this disaster.

T_GAME_QUEST_THIEF_OF_JOY_END_003_004,"Despite the efforts of your scientists to delay the process, the whole village was left unhappy. With the witch gone, you had no approach left to defend yourself against this ghost. \n\nLet's hope that time will heal the townies."
T_GAME_QUEST_THIEF_OF_JOY_END_FOR_ALL,Time has passed and the village is back in its good mood. This thief of joy is now but a distant memory.

T_GAME_QUEST_THIEF_OF_JOY_WITCH_005,"Your thief of joy does not exist, Sire."
T_GAME_QUEST_THIEF_OF_JOY_WITCH_006,But it has to be true because one of our spies suffered the consequences of talking to him!
T_GAME_QUEST_THIEF_OF_JOY_WITCH_007,"He simply saw a ghost of sadness. It occasionally appears after the construction of a religious establishment. They are spirits who feed on people's joy. \n\nBy absorbing joy, the ghost gains strength and increases its powers. Unfortunately, joy does not return to the people he stole from."
T_GAME_QUEST_THIEF_OF_JOY_WITCH_008,How do we get rid of it?
T_GAME_QUEST_THIEF_OF_JOY_WITCH_009,"I know a solution, however, I would need your help."

You feel very cold and surrounded by darkness."

T_GAME_QUEST_THIEF_OF_JOY_WITCH_A_007,Governor... What was that all about? Did you feel that too?
T_GAME_QUEST_THIEF_OF_JOY_WITCH_A_008,"Sire, you are now free of the ghost of sadness. From the look of your expressions, I guess you encountered him. It's over now. He's trapped."

T_LEGACY_LETTER_001_DESC,"By being closer to his people, he was able to help them better. So he would like to see a tavern built in this city, where tales and legends from other lands could be passed on."
T_LEGACY_LETTER_001_DESCRIPTION_001_DESC,"The first letter has arrived. It is very interesting, Sire! When our good King was still a young teenager, his father forced him to join the common folk in order to understand the tasks of each individual Townie."
T_LEGACY_LETTER_001_DESCRIPTION_002_DESC,"Thus, every week, he discovered a new profession of his people. One week as a lumberjack, the next one as a fisherman or even an innkeeper. Afterwards, he was able to more accurately estimate the needs of his people. That is remarkable, my Lord!"
T_LEGACY_LETTER_001_DESCRIPTION_003_DESC,"The profession of innkeeper has particularly challenged him. At first he thought it was only parties and drinks, so he found himself very deprived when he realized that it was offering a lot more."
T_LEGACY_LETTER_001_DESCRIPTION_004_DESC,"The tavern allowed for informal debates. From philosophy to the stories told by foreign travelers, everything was a source of wonder and reflection."
T_LEGACY_LETTER_001_SUCCESS,"Wonderful, Sire! The inhabitants are delighted with this new place full of life and warmth. The long winter evenings will be more pleasant this way."
T_LEGACY_LETTER_002_DESC,"It is said that our application to work can bring us the greatest treasure. To honor his ancestor, the King ordered us to build vines on our land. Have you already thought about a location?"
T_LEGACY_LETTER_002_DESCRIPTION_001_DESC,"We have just received the second letter. The King tells us about his childhood in the southern vineyards. During the summer, he often went there to meet his grandmother. "
T_LEGACY_LETTER_002_DESCRIPTION_002_DESC,"She told him many fables. The one that most impressed him was the one of the farmer and his sons, where he learned the importance of work. "
T_LEGACY_LETTER_002_SUCCESS,The King is very proud to see the vineyards in our village. The farmers here will take good care of it.
T_LEGACY_LETTER_003_DESC,"Therefore, the King orders us to build a warehouse and pass the message on to the people. In this sense, we can help friends in need when our stocks are full and theirs are not."
T_LEGACY_LETTER_003_DESCRIPTION_001_DESC,"Another letter has just arrived. In it, the King talks about the famine that occurred when he was barely ten years old. The whole kingdom was affected. "
T_LEGACY_LETTER_003_DESCRIPTION_002_DESC,The royal family decided to take matters into their own hands and sent diplomats to all neighboring countries to get help. 
T_LEGACY_LETTER_003_DESCRIPTION_003_DESC,"No one wanted to help the King. Most other countries were only concerned with their own survival. But the King did not despair. In the end he found a kingdom that would help. In fact, they had vast food resources, and generously shared with the other realms."
T_LEGACY_LETTER_003_DESCRIPTION_004_DESC,"The moral of the story is that you always need someone smaller than you to help. It is important to the King that the population is willing to help others in need. So, it is inevitable to stockpile goods in times of prosperity in order to be able to share them in times of need."
T_LEGACY_LETTER_003_SUCCESS,This new warehouse is perfect! Now we are able to store large stocks of all necessary goods in case of unexpected circumstances.
T_LEGACY_LETTER_004_DESC,"Our mission is to raise a statue of the King in our city, so that his wish will be granted."
T_LEGACY_LETTER_004_DESCRIPTION_001_DESC,"Sire, we have received a letter. It comes from the King. At his crowning ceremony, a great celebration took place. All the governors of the cities of his kingdom had gathered at the palace."
T_LEGACY_LETTER_004_DESCRIPTION_002_DESC,"But his dream was to be present in all the cities and villages at the same time, in order to treat everyone equally. Of course this is physically impossible. But, if a statue were placed in each city, then it could grant his wish."
T_LEGACY_LETTER_004_SUCCESS,How wonderful! The King will be thrilled. A truly magnificent monument in his honor!
T_LEGACY_LETTER_004_TITLE,Build a statue of the King.
T_LEGACY_LETTER_005_BOOK_HERE,"My Lord, the book has been completed. Our beloved King will be thrilled."
T_LEGACY_LETTER_005_DESC,"To do this, we need to collect enough skins so that our monks can write. Let's get started right away!"
T_LEGACY_LETTER_005_DESCRIPTION_001_DESC,"The last letter has just arrived, Sir. The King writes about the greatest personalities of this world and how they shared their memories in books, which were then spread all over the world. "
T_LEGACY_LETTER_005_DESCRIPTION_002_DESC,"The King wishes his memoirs to be captured in a book. It is very difficult to produce a book, but I think it would make His Majesty very happy."
T_LEGACY_LETTER_005_SUCCESS,The writing of the book can begin! Our monks will make sure that the book is ready for the King's arrival. It's so exciting! We're probably going to get famous around the whole world for this book!
T_LEGACY_LETTER_005_TITLE,Make a book that contains the King's memoirs.
T_LEGACY_LETTER_006_DESCRIPTION_001_DESC,Sir! The King is coming! I hope we haven't done anything wrong and that he will appreciate our efforts.
T_LEGACY_LETTER_006_DESCRIPTION_002_DESC,"Governor, my regards. I see that your city has grown well during my absence. Oh! That's a beautiful statue you have there! And these vines! They look like my grandmother's!"

T_LEGACY_MAINQUEST_TITLE,Help the King in his quest.
T_LEGACY_MINE_DESC,"My Lord, we will soon run out of raw materials, because we are using a large portion of them for the construction of new buildings. Should we perhaps build a mine?"
T_LEGACY_MINE_SUCCESS,"Congratulations, Lord Governor. Now we have a suitable supply of raw materials to calmly tackle the other construction projects in the village."
T_LEGACY_SECURITY_DESC,"Good afternoon, Sir. I am a messenger of the King and I was ordered to make sure that everything in the village is prepared for his arrival.\n\nWhat is THIS? Your village is far too unsecured! Build a fire tower immediately! Imagine what could happen if a fire were breaking out?!"
T_LEGACY_SECURITY_SUCCESS,That's a lot better! You never know what might happen. You did the right thing listening to me.

T_LOADINGTIP_006,Keep an eye on your Townies' happiness. Use the statistics menu to stay current on your Townies' needs and desires. 
T_LOADINGTIP_007,"The better you are at fulfilling your Townies' needs and desires, the higher they can be taxed before they go on strike."
T_LOADINGTIP_008,When the merchant comes to town you can buy urgently needed resources or sell surplus goods for money.
T_LOADINGTIP_009,"A farm can produce either wheat, wool or herbs. For wheat, you need a wheat field. For sheep, you need a pasture and for herbs a herb garden. Place them in close vicinity to the farm."
T_LOADINGTIP_010,Quickly build townhouses early on so that you have plenty of Townies to work in your production buildings.
T_LOADINGTIP_011,A small village can be easily supplied by fishermen or hunters but a bakery or butcher's workshop is better suited for large villages.

T_LOADINGTIP_021,"Townies have their own daily routine. When they are taking a break from work, they use their free time to go home to eat or to satisfy their desires."
T_LOADINGTIP_022,"When demolishing a building, half of its construction costs can be salvaged. The resources have to be hauled from the ruins by Townies, though. If you build another building in the same spot before that happens, you will lose the resources."
T_LOADINGTIP_023,Mines can only be constructed at rocky mountainsides. Mines placed on ore deposits can mine iron ore or gold ore in addition to quarrying stone.
T_LOADINGTIP_024,Roads speed up the transport of goods and resources. Your townies usually prefer to use roads. Transportation on cobblestone roads is faster than on dirt roads.
T_LOADINGTIP_025,"If your tax rate is too high, your townies will be unhappy and might even go on strike. If you fulfill some of their desires, though, they might be willing to pay higher taxes."
T_LOADINGTIP_026,"Townettes supply townhouses with food and water. They also visit the marketplace to buy jewelry and clothes, once these goods are available. Male townies, on the other hand, work in production buildings."
T_LOADINGTIP_027,If your building stores are frequently full you need to build more warehouses and assign additional carriers.
T_LOADINGTIP_028,Hard working Townies will grow tired eventually and take a break. They will resume work once rested.

T_LOADINGTIP_041,"You have several options, when a mine's resource deposit is depleted. Look for another deposit and build a new mine there or assign a geologist to a depleted mine to make more deposit accessible."
T_LOADINGTIP_042,"By increasing your town's level, you unlock powerful research. For example building upgrades, increased tax income or better quest rewards!"
T_LOADINGTIP_043,Upgraded buildings also have disadvantages:\nAdditional workers increase resource consumption and the building's repair costs increases with each upgrade!
T_LOADINGTIP_044,"When you reach certain town levels, building upgrades will be unlocked. You can upgrade buildings from their building menu by spending Prestige."
T_LOADINGTIP_045,"Researching the geologist is very useful! When you assign the geologist to a mine, he gradually replenishes the ore deposit."
T_LOADINGTIP_046,"When a new town level is reached, additional research options will be unlocked. When a research is completed, the bonuses are permanently available for all your towns! "
T_LOADINGTIP_047,"Once your town reaches a certain size, there is a risk of a plague outbreak! You will need an infirmary and a herb garden to cure your Townies."
T_LOADINGTIP_048,"When plague strikes or a fire breaks out in your town, you should immediately build an infirmary or a fire tower. The doctor cures sick Townies and the fireman extinguishes burning buildings."
T_LOADINGTIP_049,Upgrade a building to improve its performance. You can find the upgrade tab in the context menu of the building.

T_LOADINGTIP_057,Animal skins for the tannery are produced by the hunter's cabin or the butcher's workshop.

T_LOADINGTIP_062,"When supplying the soldiers with equipment and food, their offensive and defensive stats are directly affected by it. Soldiers supplied with swords will have a greater offense value."
T_LOADINGTIP_063,Try to supply your soldiers with food and drink to raise both offense and defense stats.\nWell supplied soldiers are well fighting soldiers!
T_LOADINGTIP_064,A battle consists of several phases: Both sides have to roll who begins in the initiative phase. After that the two sides strike and defend rotationally.

T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_DIPLOMATICVISIT_QUEST_CHURCH_STARTED,"My Liege, thank you for trusting me. We still need a church in this village. For a long time the inhabitants have been asking for a place where they can gather and practice their faith."
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_DIPLOMATICVISIT_QUEST_CHURCH_STARTED_02,"Especially in times like these, when bandits haunt the surrounding forests and you can't feel safe anywhere, the inhabitants need a safe haven."
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_DIPLOMATICVISIT_QUEST_CLIENT_TRANSLATION_CHURCH_TRUE,"A tavern? Having a church seems more important to have in our town, now especially with the recent bandits attacks, people need a place to feel safe."
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_DIPLOMATICVISIT_QUEST_FAIRGROUND_FALSE,A jousting ground... are you sure? I think she means a fairground. This would be definitely a better option for our village. It will allow us to get to know the different peaceful festivities of both Kingdoms.

T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_DIPLOMATICVISIT_QUEST_REACTION_QUEEN_BREAD_TRIBUTE,Oh. She seems disappointed and happy at the same time. What does this mean?

T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_DIPLOMATICVISIT_QUEST_REACTION_QUEEN_FAIRGROUND,Seems like we got it all wrong. The Queen is upset. Why did you listen to your adviser? He doesn’t even speak the Queen‘s language!

T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_BUILD_INN_OR_BATH_DESC,"Sir, that smell is horrible... The people of the village have stopped washing themselves. Perhaps bathhouses would improve their daily lives, as well as ours. But on the other hand... the Duke would rather have an inn built to increase the income of his estate. \n\nIt is up to you to make this difficult choice. What will it be: The inn or the bathhouse?"
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_BUILD_INN_SUCCESS,Wealth is coming our way! What a splendid idea this inn was. It is a beauty.
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_BUILD_INN_TITLE,Build an inn.
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_BUILD_WATCHTOWERS_DESC,"You are building glorious buildings here and there, but it may be time to start erect additional guard towers. Our defenses were too weak last time, it's time to counteract."

T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_ENDING_ALL_DUKE,"You have been a true friend to me, Lord. I am truly thankful to you for your support in the affairs of the town.\n\nUnfortunately, the population thinks differently. The ungrateful rabble is standing in the castle courtyard with torches and pitchforks. I suggest you take the secret passage and escape the town as fast as you can.\n\nI will stay here and talk to them. I think the true culprit of this mess should face the consequences of his actions and clear his conscience."
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_ENDING_ALL_TOWNIES,"You have always stood in my way, Lord. From the beginning on you decided against my wishes. The town was more important to you than the Duke.\n\nUnfortunately, the population does not see it like me. The ungrateful rabble is standing in the castle courtyard. Why don't you join them?\n\nMy brother has been freed by your men and from now on he will reign the place. He has always been the true ruler here.\nI will now go outside because the true culprit of this mess should face the angry Townies and come clean with his conscience."
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_ENDING_BALANCE_DUKE,"My Lord, you have truly proved that through all these difficult decisions, you have represented both the welfare of the Townies and the desires of the Duke with the best of your knowledge and conscience.\n\nIn spite of the fundamentally equal treatment of both parties, you have attended to the Duke's needs more and given priority to his demands.\n\nYou really deserve the reputation of being a problem solver."

T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_FISH_OUT_SUCCESS,"My Lord, your choice to spend the money on making the town safer might have offended the Duke. "
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_FISH_OUT_SUCCESS_PART2,"He regards it as an insult that the financial backbone of the village, fishing, was not close to your heart and that you preferred to help the anxious Townies.\n "
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_FISH_STARTED,"I’m glad that you have chosen to invest in our fishing trade. I see, that I can count on you doing the right thing.\n\nWe need to produce a certain amount of fish in order to be profitable. "
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_FISH_SUCCESS,Selling these culinary delicacies provides us with some good turnover to keep the town running.\nThe prices for fish are really favorable at the moment.

T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_FRAGMENT3_SUCCESS,"One day, the twins found out that only one of them could rule the town. The good twin was ready to leave the place to his brother but, for the other one, it was not enough. "
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_FRAGMENT4_SUCCESS,The evil twin forced his brother to fight in a duel. But his twin was too strong and he lost the fight. 
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_FRAGMENT5_SUCCESS,The evil twin couldn’t live with this defeat. He faked his own death by jumping into the river. Even his brother thought he was dead. 
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_FRAGMENT6_SUCCESS,"After that, the good twin ruled the town. That time was prosperous and full of joy. But in the forest, helped by the bandits, the evil twin was preparing his revenge."
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_FRAGMENT7_SUCCESS,"A few weeks ago, he started his plan of revenge. Nobody noticed it, but the evil twin took the place of his brother. Reversing all the good work our Duke has done and burning down the town little by little.\nUntil you, my Lord, answered my call for help."
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_GUARDS_OR_ATK_DESC,"Sir, I don't want to rush you, but you're going to have to make a decision sooner or later. Should we build watchtowers or attack these naughty bandits now? "
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_HELP1,"My Lord, the roads are in a very poor condition. Would you be so kind as to order the construction of new ones? I almost broke my ankle yesterday."

T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_MEAT_SUCCESS,Oh I see that you have the goods. Give it to me and I will tell you where I got my herbal medicine from.
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_MEAT_SUCCESS_002,"It’s down by the river. But I don’t get there anymore, some nasty bandits have set up their camp right next to the herbs."
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_MEAT_SUCCESS_OLD,"Now, I will tell you where I got my herbal medicine from. It’s down by the river. But I don’t go there anymore, some nasty bandits have set up their camp right next to the herbs."
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_MEMORY1_SUCCESS,"My Lord, I must confess. I miss the old times when the Duke and his twin played in these streets. The town was bright and full of joy. I remember when they were talking about how they would rule the town together. But...things went differently.\n\nAaahhh...I should not talk about that, what's past is past, right?"
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_MERCHANT_SUCCESS,"My Lord, I would like to thank you for fixing the roads. \n\nI also have a message for you. A few days ago, I found a note near the river. It was a call for help. It seems like a person is being held hostage by the bandits. Maybe you can do something."

Most of it is incomprehensible, but the rest of the message reads like this:\n\n“...it’s been a while... I don’t know how he made it... He is the evil one of us... thought he was dead… we were so wrong... Please... Help…”"
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_SICK1A_SUCCESS,"While you were busy with the Duke’s demand, the Townies caught some kind of strange disease due to the lack of variety in their diet. I’ve heard that most of them are ready to leave town."
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_SICK1_STARTED,"My Lord, it is advisable to cure the villagers before the sickness starts spreading in town."
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_SICK1_SUCCESS,Everyone is feeling better. But the Townies blame you for everything and they believe that you are just as much of a madman as the Duke.
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_SICK1_SUCCESS_PART2,You chose poorly by spending the money on the roads. They think that a bakery would have been more beneficial for the town. The Townies could really use some variety in their diet.
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_STORY_STARTED,"My Lord, you must know that from time to time, our Duke acts very strangely. He demands insane tasks of us. If they are not carried out to his satisfaction, he orders the destruction of buildings."
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_STORY_STARTED1,"There is another problem, my Lord. The treasury is empty. "
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_TORCH_STARTED,I’m glad that you have chosen to invest the money in the protection of the town. A couple of torches will dissuade the bandits to raid our town.

T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_TOWNIE_1A_FAILED,"Oh my Lord, that’s terrible, the construction is taking too long. The Townies are thinking that it was on purpose. Some of them are calling for a revolt…"
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_TOWNIE_1A_STARTED,"If things go on like this, my Lord, the village will soon be in trouble. In such times, one should be prepared for everything. I'm talking about things like fire...don't you think a fire tower would be a good investment?\nShould I commission the construction, sir?"
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_TOWNIE_1A_SUCCESS,"That fire tower was completed just in time, my Lord. Townies are happy to see that we care about them."
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_TOWNIE_1A_SUCCESS_NEW,"The construction was completed in time, my Lord. The villagers are delighted with your concern for their well-being."
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_TOWNIE_1B_FAILED,"Oh my Lord, bandits have heard of our small guard force in town. They might come here sooner than expected."
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_TOWNIE_1B_STARTED,"My Lord, may I make a suggestion?\n\nIn order to prepare the population for the threat of bandit attacks, we should organize a competition. That way we could find out who is suitable to be a guardsman and who knows how to use the bow.\n\nShould I have a contest site commissioned, sir?"
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_TOWNIE_1B_SUCCESS,This archery contest was a success! Some Townies are asking to be guardsmen that are patrolling our streets. Maybe we really do have a chance to fight off the bandits.
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_TOWNIE_2_STARTED,"My Lord, last season the Duke destroyed the farms. The villagers are unable to provide for themselves and their dependents. \nIt would be advisable to construct a new farm to ease their problems. "

T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_TOWNIE_3_CHOICE_STARTED,"My Lord, why don’t we walk the streets so you can see for yourself what the situation is. It might have a positive influence on the villagers if they see that you are concerned about their well-being."
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_TOWNIE_4_STARTED,"My Lord, the bandits in this area are getting stronger by the minute. We need to prepare, in case they are attacking our village.\n\nShould I order the construction of guard towers?"
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_TOWNIE_4_STARTED_NEW,"My Lord, the bandits in this area are getting stronger by the minute. We need to prepare, in case they will be attacking our village.\n\nShould I order the construction of defense buildings?"
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_TOWNIE_4_SUCCESS,"With these towers, we will be able to see the bandits a long time before they are in town."
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_TOWNIE_5_STARTED,"I have an idea my Lord, please hear me out. Why don’t we just pay the bandits? Maybe they would leave us alone then. We could bribe them with some nice goods. And money, of course."
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_TOWNIE_5_SUCCESS,"Oh, we got all the resources for the bribe, let’s give it to the bandits."
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_TOWNIE_5_TITLE,Pay the bribe.
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_TOWNIE_6_CHOICE_STARTED,"My Lord, I just came from the Duke. He instructed me to have a tavern built.\n\nBut on the other hand, the Townies have been asking for a church for a long time now.\n\nThe choice is yours."
T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_TOWNIE_FIRE_SUCCESS,"FIRE! FIRE! A fire has broken out in town, my Lord!"

T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_INSANECHOICES_QUEST_TRIBUTELIEGE_SUCCESS,"You did the right thing. Having a tavern is much better than having a church in town, don’t you think? Besides, it is already full of newcomers."

T_QUESTS_SCENARIO_THEBEAST_ATK_001_CONCLUSION_ADVISOR_001,"Did you hear that, my Lord? Maybe it was one of the locals who did it. But doing laundry on a Monday when it is customary for it to be done on a Saturday is also a strange idea. Anyway, the important thing is that she's safe and sound."

T_QUESTS_TWELVE_WORK_010_SUCCESS,"We've done it, Lord! A truly beautiful feast is being arranged to celebrate the restoration of your honor and the rebirth of our proud town!"

T_RANDOM_EVENT_WITCHHUNT_CHOICE_POPUP_01_REPLY_03,What happened exactly?
T_RANDOM_EVENT_WITCHHUNT_CHOICE_POPUP_02_DESC,Suddenly the woman is starting mumbling in a strange language and is having some kind of seizure. Her movements and groans are nothing you have ever seen before...

T_RANDOM_EVENT_WITCHHUNT_CHOICE_POPUP_03_REPLY_01,Throw her in the dungeon.

T_RANDOM_EVENT_WITCHHUNT_CHOICE_POPUP_04_DESC_02,"Suddenly one of the bystanding villagers screams and falls to the ground, having similar seizures and starts to mumble strangely, too. The crowd disperses. ""It's spreading!"", one of the others screams. ""You have to do something, Mylord""."

T_RANDOM_EVENT_WITCHHUNT_CHOICE_POPUP_05_DESC,"The monks from the monastery arrive after a while. The woman is thoroughly examined by the clerics. One of the monks looks at you and speaks with a low voice: ""This could be a demonic presence taking possession of villagers, my Lord!"" We could ask a preacher to perform an ritual or a doctor for advice. Another possibility is to have the villagers sort out the issue."
T_RANDOM_EVENT_WITCHHUNT_CHOICE_POPUP_05_REPLY_01,Call for a religious ritual!
T_RANDOM_EVENT_WITCHHUNT_CHOICE_POPUP_05_REPLY_02,Ask the doctor for advice.

T_RANDOM_EVENT_WITCHHUNT_CHOICE_POPUP_08_REPLY_02,Let the doctor examine the victim.
T_RANDOM_EVENT_WITCHHUNT_CHOICE_POPUP_10_DESC,"The villagers are speaking of the weird behavior of the woman. ""She is a herbalist"", the farmer says, ""everyone comes to her when they are ill. Since a week or so she started acting weird. Talking with herself, doing strange things in her house."

T_RANDOM_EVENT_WITCHHUNT_CHOICE_POPUP_14_DESC,"Well, one night we heard her scream around the house. Like she was seeing things... maledictions or something like that,"" the farmer says. ""The other day, she was in front of the house when the demonic presence took hold of her, shaking her and starting the fever."
T_RANDOM_EVENT_WITCHHUNT_CHOICE_POPUP_14_REPLY_01,Maybe she was poisoned somehow?
T_RANDOM_EVENT_WITCHHUNT_CHOICE_POPUP_14_REPLY_02,What happened before she got weird?
T_RANDOM_EVENT_WITCHHUNT_CHOICE_POPUP_15_DESC,"Only mumbling comes out of the victim. She is very feverish and sweating heavily. When she does open her eyes, she can't focus on any face and her pupils are quite large."
T_RANDOM_EVENT_WITCHHUNT_CHOICE_POPUP_15_REPLY_01,Call the doctor!
T_RANDOM_EVENT_WITCHHUNT_CHOICE_POPUP_15_REPLY_01A,Have the victim examined.
T_RANDOM_EVENT_WITCHHUNT_CHOICE_POPUP_15_REPLY_03,The monks may know what to do.
T_RANDOM_EVENT_WITCHHUNT_CHOICE_POPUP_16_DESC,"Well"", the farmer says ""The harvest was moderate this year. There was an unusual amount of brown wheat in the harvest. The miller said that it was not enough for the winter and the feast so he used the brown ones for the flour, too."
T_RANDOM_EVENT_WITCHHUNT_CHOICE_POPUP_17_DESC,"After the baker brought all the bread we had a big feast to celebrate the harvest. He even brought a special new type of bread he baked out of the brown wheat. The feast was unusually wild this year. A lot of the villagers complained about stomach pain the next day, but that is usually the case when a feast like that takes place. The baker threw away the rest of the bread, because he thought it tasted kinda funny..."
T_RANDOM_EVENT_WITCHHUNT_CHOICE_POPUP_17_REPLY_01,Investigate the brown wheat.
T_RANDOM_EVENT_WITCHHUNT_CHOICE_POPUP_17_REPLY_02,Lets check the house of the woman.
T_RANDOM_EVENT_WITCHHUNT_CHOICE_POPUP_18_DESC,"Since the witch was quite poor, she seemed to have taken some of the ""special"" bread for herself after the baker threw it away. In her house you can find some of the bread still uneaten."
T_RANDOM_EVENT_WITCHHUNT_CHOICE_POPUP_18_REPLY_01,Let the doctor analyze the bread.
T_RANDOM_EVENT_WITCHHUNT_CHOICE_POPUP_18_REPLY_02,Interesting.
T_RANDOM_EVENT_WITCHHUNT_CHOICE_POPUP_19_DESC,"While the doctor is away, more and more villagers complain about stomach pain and having seizures. The villagers are asking for a cure. What should we do?"

T_RANDOM_EVENT_WITCHHUNT_CHOICE_POPUP_19_REPLY_02,Wait for the doctor to return.
T_RANDOM_EVENT_WITCHHUNT_CHOICE_POPUP_19_REPLY_03,We have to find out what really happened.
T_RANDOM_EVENT_WITCHHUNT_CHOICE_POPUP_20_DESC,"After some time the doctor returns from the capital. He brings good news and immediately comes forward with them. ""It is not witchcraft!” It is ergot poisoning of the harvest. We should immediately destroy the remaining harvest to make sure this won't be happening again. Ergot poisoning can lead to seizures, hallucinations and complete lethargy,"" he said."
T_RANDOM_EVENT_WITCHHUNT_CHOICE_POPUP_20_DESC_2,"You have to make the decision, Lord. Either we keep the remaining harvest and try to cultivate more of this ergot or we destroy everything of the harvest for the sake of our villagers. What do you suggest to do?"
T_RANDOM_EVENT_WITCHHUNT_CHOICE_POPUP_20_PART_01,"After some time the doctor returns from the capital. He brings good news and immediately comes forward with them. ""It is not witchcraft!”"
T_RANDOM_EVENT_WITCHHUNT_CHOICE_POPUP_20_PART_02,"It is ergot poisoning of the harvest. We should immediately destroy the remaining harvest to make sure this won't be happening again. Ergot poisoning can lead to seizures, hallucinations and lethargy,"" he says. We have to destroy it."
T_RANDOM_EVENT_WITCHHUNT_CHOICE_POPUP_20_PART_03,"My lord, wait! This ergot on the harvest, yes, it can be dangerous when overdosed. But the villagers were quite relaxed and happy when they consumed only small dosages. Maybe we have an opportunity here for the villagers prosperity and wellbeing."
T_RANDOM_EVENT_WITCHHUNT_CHOICE_POPUP_20_REPLY_01,Destroy the rest of the harvest.
T_RANDOM_EVENT_WITCHHUNT_CHOICE_POPUP_20_REPLY_02,Maybe this ergot has something good in it. We keep it.
T_RANDOM_EVENT_WITCHHUNT_DESC,A crying woman is dragged by a couple of villagers into the courtyard. She looks sore but otherwise unharmed. The villagers demand that action is taken against the supposed witch. What do you do with her?
T_RANDOM_EVENT_WITCHHUNT_END_DESTROYEVERYTHING,"After the harvest and all supplies with the ergot fungus had been destroyed, peace slowly returned to the village.\n\nNevertheless, the whole event had a positive effect on the village. The villagers are now more diligent at work and less exhausted."
T_RANDOM_EVENT_WITCHHUNT_END_KEEP_DRUGS,"From now on, the farmers will cultivate wheats that are faster infested with ergot. The medicus has already started to create a tincture containing small amounts of the new miracle cure.\n\nThis has the permanent positive effect that the inhabitants are a little happier, but also a little lazier."
T_RANDOM_EVENT_WITCHHUNT_EXORCISM_DESC,"My Lord, in order to prepare the healing power of faith, we still need some materials. Would you be so kind as to send me the appropriate ingredients."
